Typosquatting is a form of internet cybersquatting generated from the mistakes (typos) made by internet users while typing a website address.

This project is aimed to predict most potential typosquatting errors for a new domain name. 
The prediction was done by training an RNN model with preprocessed DNS log data using the Python deep learning library Keras.
Both the dataset and source code are provided.
